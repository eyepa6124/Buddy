## 💡 What is Buddy?

Buddy is a **zero-UI, zero-friction AI text companion** for Android. It lives quietly in the background as an Accessibility Service and springs to action exactly when you need it — without ever leaving your current app.

Finished typing a WhatsApp message but want it to sound more professional? Type `/formal` at the end. Wrote a rough email draft? Append `/improve`. Need a quick reply to that message? Type `/reply`. Buddy intercepts the text, sends it to your configured AI (Gemini, Groq, OpenAI, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), and **replaces it inline** — in under 2 seconds.

No copy-paste. No app-switching. No ChatGPT tab. Just type and trigger.

```
Input:   "plz send me the docs asap /formal"
                          ↓ (spinner animates in the text field: ✦ ✧ ✦ ✧)
Output:  "Could you please send over the documents at your earliest convenience?"
```

## 📦 Download

| Property | Value |
|:---|:---|
| **Version** | v1.4 |
| **APK Size** | ~20.4 MB (20,883 KB) |
| **Architecture** | arm64-v8a |
| **Min Android** | Android 6.0 (API 23) |
| **Target Android** | Android 15 (API 35) |

### ✨ What's New in v1.4
- **AI Temperature Control:** A brand-new **"AI Creativity"** section has been added to Settings. A smooth slider lets you dial the temperature from `0.0` (focused & deterministic) all the way to `2.0` (highly creative & varied). The selected value is persisted in SharedPreferences and passed to all providers — Gemini, Groq, and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint — replacing the old hardcoded default.
- **Redesigned Keys Screen:** The API Keys page received a major facelift:
  - A new **Usage Dashboard** widget at the top displays a 7-day mini bar chart of your AI request activity alongside a **"Most Used"** command card — all at a glance.
  - Key cards are now cleaner and more compact, showing *"Provider Name Key #"* (e.g., `Gemini Key 1`) instead of the masked key string with badge chips.
  - The **Save Key** button is now taller (`48 dp`) with a rounded `12 dp` corner radius for a more polished look.
- **Redesigned Commands Screen:** The Commands tab received an extensive visual overhaul for a more intuitive and modern browsing experience.
- **About Section in Settings:** A new **"About"** section with a tappable *"Support Buddy"* card links directly to the GitHub repository — a quick one-tap way to star the project.

### ✨ Prior Release (v1.3)
- **Groq API Support:** Complete integration for Groq as a first-class AI provider, bringing lightning-fast inferences. Supported models include:
  - `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
  - `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
  - `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
  - `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
  - `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- **Redesigned Settings & Keys UI:** Completely revamped the Settings and Keys page to be more user-friendly, intuitive, and easier to navigate for seamless API key management.

### ✨ Prior Release (v1.2)
- **Premium API Analytics:** Keep track of the stability and success rate of your AI queries. Select any of your keys to launch a highly detailed dashboard tracking total requests, error rates, and active usage statistics globally.
- **Intelligent Key Identity:** Keys are no longer ambiguously numbered. When you add a new key, the app dynamically identifies the provider signature (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Custom, Groq) and tags it properly!
- **Sleeker Commands Experience:** Handcrafted a new floating `ModalBottomSheet` experience triggered by a FAB for adding/editing Custom Commands so the screen is never cluttered by permanent text fields. Command cards also received high-quality custom color badges (`Built-in`, `Text Replacer`, `AI`) that flawlessly match the premium dark theme!

### ✨ Prior Release (v1.1)
- **History Tab:** Keep track of every AI generation and text replacement locally. Easily copy, review, or clear your past outputs directly from the new bottom navigation bar.
- **Static Text Replacers:** Create custom commands that instantly expand to normal static text (e.g. typing `/address` to output your home address) completely bypassing the AI for zero delays!
- **In-App Updater:** The Dashboard now shows a compact GitHub button in the top-right corner — tap to star the repo when up to date, or get a direct link to the latest release when an update is available.
- **Banking App Quick-Toggle:** A new informational card on the Dashboard clearly explains that banking apps block Accessibility Services. A one-tap **"Turn Off"** button takes you directly to the Accessibility Settings to disable Buddy before opening sensitive apps.
- **Enhanced UI:** Added explicit numbered indexing for your encrypted API Keys, plus completely interactive redirect links seamlessly letting you generate Gemini and OpenAI keys directly from the browser.
- **Strict Language Preservation:** Completely eradicated auto-translation side-effects. You can seamlessly type casually in Hinglish (or any specific alphabet) and the AI will critically preserve your alphabet structure returning strict Hinglish rather than breaking into Devanagari.

> ℹ️ **Why ~20 MB?** Buddy bundles the full **Python 3.12 interpreter** via [Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/) to handle AI API calls natively inside the APK — no Termux, no server, no extra installs needed.

## 🤖 AI Providers

Buddy supports multiple provider modes:

### Google Gemini (Default)

| Model | Notes |
|:------|:------|
| `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` | **Default.** 
| `gemini-3-flash-preview` | 
| `gemini-3.1-flash-light-preview` |

Get your free API key at [Google AI Studio →](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)

### Groq

Native Groq integration for lightning-fast speeds. Supported models:
- `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- `meta-llama/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`
- `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
- `openai/gpt-oss-120b`

Get your free API key at [Groq Console →](https://console.groq.com/keys)

### Custom / OpenAI-Compatible

Buddy can connect to any OpenAI-compatible endpoint:

- **OpenAI** — `https://api.openai.com/v1` with `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4o`, etc.
<!-- Groq moved to native integration -->
- **OpenRouter** — `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` (access 200+ models)
- **Ollama** (local) — `http://localhost:11434/v1` with `llama3`, `mistral`, etc.
- **LM Studio** — `http://localhost:1234/v1`
- **Puter AI** — Free OpenAI-compatible tier

**Configuration:**
1. Open **Settings** in Buddy
2. Select your provider (**Gemini**, **Groq**, or **Custom / OpenAI-compatible**)
3. Enter your **Model name** and **Endpoint URL**
4. Add the API key in the **Keys** tab

### Multi-Key Round Robin

Add multiple API keys from the same or different accounts — Buddy **automatically rotates** through them:

- Distributes load evenly across keys
- Skips rate-limited keys and retries with the next available key
- Marks invalid/expired keys to avoid wasted calls
- Auto-recovers rate-limited keys after the cooldown window expires

---

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

Buddy is designed with a strict **privacy-first** philosophy:

### What Buddy Does NOT Do
- ❌ No analytics or telemetry — zero tracking
- ❌ No intermediary servers — your text never touches Buddy's servers (there are none)
- ❌ No data collection, storage, or logging
- ❌ No internet access except for direct AI API calls you configure
- ❌ No ads, no account required, no sign-up

### What Buddy Does
- ✅ All API keys encrypted at rest using **AES-256-GCM via Android Keystore**
- ✅ Text only leaves your device when you intentionally trigger an AI command
- ✅ Data flows **directly** from your device → your configured AI provider, nowhere else
- ✅ Accessibility Service only reads text when a trigger character is detected (not a keylogger)
- ✅ Password fields are **explicitly blocked** — Buddy never reads or modifies password inputs
- ✅ No clipboard snooping — clipboard is only touched as a fallback injection method, and the original clip is restored within 500ms

### Android Keystore Encryption Details

```
Algorithm:    AES-256-GCM
Key storage:  Android Hardware Security Module (HSM) / TEE
Key alias:    typeslate_secure_key
Padding:      NoPadding (GCM handles authentication)
IV:           Auto-generated per encryption, stored alongside ciphertext
```

Your API keys are hardware-bound — they cannot be extracted from the device even with root access.

### Permissions Required

| Permission | Reason |
|:-----------|:--------|
| `BIND_ACCESSIBILITY_SERVICE` | Core functionality — detects text changes and injects AI responses |
| `INTERNET` | Direct API calls to your configured AI provider |
| `VIBRATE` | Haptic feedback on success/failure |
| `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` | Overlay toast notifications (via `TYPE_ACCESSIBILITY_OVERLAY`) |

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Details |
|:------|:-----------|:--------|

## 🔨 Building from Source

> **Prerequisites:** Android Studio Hedgehog (2023.1.1) or newer, Android SDK, JDK 17

### Step 1 — Install Android Studio

Download from [developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and install with default settings (include Android SDK).

### Step 2 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Musheer360/Buddy.git
cd Buddy
```

### Step 3 — Open in Android Studio

1. Launch Android Studio
2. Click **"Open"** (not "New Project")
3. Navigate to the cloned `Buddy` folder → click **OK**
4. Wait for **Gradle sync** to complete

> ⚠️ First sync downloads ~500 MB (Android SDK components + Chaquopy Python 3.12). This is a one-time operation.

### Step 4 — Connect a Device

1. On your Android phone: **Settings → About Phone → tap Build Number 7×** (enables Developer Mode)
2. **Settings → Developer Options → USB Debugging → ON**
3. Connect phone via USB → tap **"Allow"** when prompted on the device

> Alternatively, use an Android Emulator (API 23+) from Android Studio's AVD Manager.

### Step 5 — Build & Run

Click the **▶ Run** button (green triangle) in Android Studio toolbar.

This will:
- Compile Kotlin sources
- Bundle Python 3.12 + scripts via Chaquopy
- Install the APK on your connected device
- Launch the app automatically

First build typically takes **3–7 minutes**. Subsequent builds are much faster.

### Step 6 — Build a Release APK

```bash
# From the project root
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

Output APK: `app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

> You'll need a signing keystore for release builds. Generate one via **Build → Generate Signed APK** in Android Studio.

### Troubleshooting Build Issues

| Problem | Fix |
|:--------|:----|
| Gradle sync fails: "Chaquopy not found" | Check internet connection; Chaquopy downloads on first sync |
| `"Python not started"` crash on launch | Ensure `android:name=".BuddyApp"` is set in `AndroidManifest.xml` |
| APK installs but AI doesn't respond | Verify your API key in the Keys tab |
| Accessibility service not listed | Reinstall the APK, then re-check Settings → Accessibility |
| Build error about ABI filters | Edit `app/build.gradle.kts` → remove `x86_64` from `abiFilters` |
| `CheckAarMetadata` errors | Ensure all dependencies are compatible with `compileSdk 35` |

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Text Field Compatibility

Buddy uses Android's standard `ACTION_SET_TEXT` accessibility action. Most apps work perfectly. However:

- **Chrome address bar / WebViews** — Text injection may be resisted. Buddy automatically falls back to clipboard-based paste injection.
- **WeChat / aggressive wrappers** — Custom text engines may block injection entirely.
- **Some OEM keyboards** — May not fire the expected accessibility events.

### Background Service (Battery Optimization)

Aggressive OEM battery management may kill the Accessibility Service in the background:

| Manufacturer | Fix |
|:-------------|:----|
| **Xiaomi / MIUI** | Settings → Apps → Buddy → Battery Saver → No restrictions |
| **OnePlus / OxygenOS** | Settings → Battery → Battery Optimization → Buddy → Don't optimize |
| **Huawei / EMUI** | Settings → Apps → Buddy → Battery → Enable "Auto-launch" |
| **Samsung** | Settings → Device Care → Battery → Background usage limits → Exempt Buddy |

### General Notes

- Buddy requires an **active internet connection** to make AI API calls (unless using a local model via Ollama/LM Studio)
- The `/undo` command only reverts **one level** (the most recent replacement)
- Very long texts may occasionally hit AI provider **token limits** — use `/shorten` on the result if needed
- Accessibility Services must be **re-enabled** after app updates on some devices
- **Banking & finance apps** (e.g. PhonePe, HDFC, SBI, Paytm) actively block apps that run Accessibility Services as an OS-level security measure. Buddy cannot bypass this. Use the **"Turn Off Buddy"** quick-toggle on the Dashboard to disable the service in one tap before opening sensitive apps, then re-enable it when done.
